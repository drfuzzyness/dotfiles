# drfuzzyness' config files

This is less a true collection of dotfiles and more a collection of the config files that rule my life. I'll probably slowly add more to this.

## `keyboard-layouts`

These are config files for the keyboards that I use.

- `gemini-keyboard-layout.json`
	- The keyboard layout I use for my [Hexgears Gemini Dawn keyboard](https://kono.store/products/gemini-dawn). Import this into the [Hexgears Configurator](https://github.com/hexgears/configurator).
